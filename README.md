## Description

> This is currently undergoing significant changes as the remaster is being built from the legacy app. More updates will be coming soon!

To help contribute, go to the [Legacy App](https://github.com/wanderers-guide/wanderers-guide-legacy/tree/main/services/express) and follow the README there. If you would like to contribute to the rework, come chat to us on the [Wanderers Guide Discord](https://discord.gg/kxCpa6G) and search tag `@developer` in the development channel.

## Setup

1. Install node.js using the instructions here: <https://nodejs.org/en/download>
2. Install the supabase CLI for your OS following the instructions: <https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started>
3. Run `supabase start` to initialize supabase locally, this will print a few details about the supabase local development setup that will be required later
4. Go into the `data/` folder and run `./create-db.sh <DB_URL>` (replace `<DB_URL>` with value obtained in step 3; default `postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres`). This will create all the tables needed
5. Go into the `frontend/` directory
6. Copy `.env.local.template` to `.env.local` and replace the placeholder variables in `.env.local`
    - replace `<API_URL>` and `<ANON_KEY>` with the values obtained in step 3
    - `<DDDICE_API_KEY>` needs to be replaced with the API key to [dddice](https://dddice.com)
    - Replacing `<DDDICE_API_KEY>` can be omitted, but it won't be possible to roll virtual dice then
    - The API key can be generated by creating a [dddice](https://dddice.com) account, visitng ["My Account" -> "Developers"](https://dddice.com/account/developer) and clicking on "Create API Key"
7. Run `npm install`
8. Run `npm run dev` - this will run the frontend
9. In another terminal window run `supabase functions serve` at project root level to initialize the backend

### Creating a user

To properly access the website you need to register a user.

1. Go to the local supabase studio URL (default <http://127.0.0.1:54323>)
2. In the authentication page, create a new user with email and password. Copy the User UUID generated
3. Go to the Table Editor page and select the `public_user` table. Insert the following snippet into the table (Insert -> Paste Text); make sure to substitute the "UUID HERE" string for the User UUID generate in step 2
```csv
id,created_at,user_id,display_name,image_url,background_image_url,site_theme,is_admin,is_mod,deactivated,summary,subscribed_content_sources,patreon,organized_play_id,is_developer,is_community_paragon
1,2024-04-03 21:30:01.720023+00,UUID HERE,User Name,,,,false,false,false,,,,,true,
```
4. Login with the email and password
